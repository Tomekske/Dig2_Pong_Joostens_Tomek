2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock xxx/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin xxx/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock xxx/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Hsync relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Vsync relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaRed[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#12 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaRed[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#13 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaRed[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#14 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaRed[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

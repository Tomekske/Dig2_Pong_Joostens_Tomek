2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock xxx/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 and sys_clk_pin are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks sys_clk_pin]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Hsync relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on Vsync relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaBlue[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaGreen[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaRed[0] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#12 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaRed[1] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#13 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaRed[2] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#14 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on vgaRed[3] relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch rr/R_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin rr/R_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock xxx/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin xxx/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
